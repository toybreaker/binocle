When two Italian entrepreneurs renovated their villa in a small town near Novar, they decided to use part of the basement as a display for their art collection. Despite the intentions, the 90 sqm room remained idle for several years and the artworks were left in their wooden crates until the couple took the initiative and asked BINOCLE to transform the basement into a private exhibition space.


The project is made of very few elements that leave unchanged the existing space to modify only its light, color and atmosphere.


The galvanized trays - attached to the ceiling to host the electrical installations - are kept and used as the support for the new linear lights replacing the existing ones, visually bulky and technically unfit.


Poplar plywood sliding panels are hanged to galvanized iron rails and organized along the perimeter of the room: sometimes the panels cover the existing windows, sometimes they work as sliding doors hiding two big wooden libraries and a little desk, either way and above all the boardings are - together with the existing concrete walls - the support to display the artworks from the owners collection.


On the 6th of October 2012 the Gallery was opened the public with an exhibition entitled ‘Johannesburg’ featuring works by Gabriele Basilico, Piero Pizzi Cannella, David Finn, Mona Hatoum, William Kentridge, Anselm Kiefer, Saba Naim and Pascale Marthine Tayou.
