Our office is located atop of an unusual building from the 30’s known by people from Milan as ‘Cremlino’. The dome, under which we moved in 2014, measures 9 m in diameter, 5.5 m in height, overlooks the entire city and culminates into a 12 m spire.

To make space for our books and tools, to provide a proper entrance and to organize a raised bed for our guests, we designed and built a 2.5 m black-painted OSB wooden cube.
