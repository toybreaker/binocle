Two storeys of a neoclassical building in the centre of Oleggio have been transformed into a space for art (SPA - Spazio Per Arte) on the initiative of a family of collectors. 500 sqm have been renovated, restored and updated through a project developed under the guidance of the Superintendency of Archaeology, Fine Arts and Landscape for the province of Novara. Through this fruitful collaboration the historical layers to be maintained were identified and the best strategies to make past and present elements coexist and complement one another were defined. In these photographs the space appears either empty or set up with works by artists such as Vanessa Beecroft, Martin Disler, Elmgreen & Dragset, Mona Hatoum, Anne Imhof, Wolfgang Laib, Anselm Kiefer, Robin Rhode and Pascale Marthine Tayou.
