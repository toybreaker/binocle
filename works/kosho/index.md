Our proposal for Sukkah City, a design competition that took place in New York in 2010, was a do-it-yourself structure tested during the development of our entry through a 1:1 scale prototype.

KOSHO is a symmetrical polyhedron, simply assembled through the use of modular elements and easily replicable by anyone willing to follow our shared manual of instructions.
