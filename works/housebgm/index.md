A "L" shaped 70 sqm attic - converted to accommodate a family of 3 - is organized in two areas of identical size and opposite characteristics.

The living area is a single space without any physical separation in which all the different activities coexist. The sleeping area is organized around a tiny corridor with 6 doors and is made up of very small rooms clearly divided between each other. A long balcony and a large terrace surround and complete the apartment.
