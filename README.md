## No frills editing Guide:

**Set homepage photo**   
Tag the chosen photo with ```#pictureoftheday``` hash. Bum. done! (probably it needs to be a recent uploaded shot...)

**Update contact infos, tel?**     
Change [lines 11>15 in this file](https://github.com/toybreaker/binocle/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml)

**PROFILE fine tuning?**     
Edit [this file](https://github.com/toybreaker/binocle/blob/gh-pages/_includes/editables/profile.md)


**PROFILE image change?**     
Upload a picture named profile.jpg to the shared gdrive folder with same specs as for works images, then it will be processed by gulp as works images. (If in a hurry [upload](https://github.com/toybreaker/binocle/tree/gh-pages/assets/p) 3 pictures properly dimensioned named profile-640.jpg, profile-1024.jpg, profile-1920.jpg overwriting the existing ones.)

**WORKS: disable + enable project?**   
Move project row form [works.csv](https://github.com/toybreaker/binocle/blob/gh-pages/_data/works.csv) to [works_to_finish.csv](https://github.com/toybreaker/binocle/blob/gh-pages/_data/works_to_finish.csv). When done, move it back.

## LIMITS (BUGS?!)

- Instagram feed serving only 640x640. How to get 1080? We can't. See this [instanfeed.js open bug](https://github.com/stevenschobert/instafeed.js/issues/393) (I'm afraid Instagrams API doesn't support the full resolution yet.)

- instafeed.js: (limit:1) not working
