Developed in 2010 for an invited competition, this design proposal envisaged a new model of store and suggested a new shopping experience for Nikeâ€™s customers and supporters.

The efficiency of ordinary retail spaces is enhanced by the presence of an unconventional room in which the history of the brand and the celebration of its myth are continuously staged.
