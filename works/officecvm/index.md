An office space for multiple purposes located in a courtyard of a historical Milanese building. The classic technique of the terrazzo floor is reinterpreted here with a distinctive layout. The apparently shapeless motive, is actually the replica of the very same principle of ‘six tableaux’, which is based on the act of sampling existing forms transferring them into a different contest.
