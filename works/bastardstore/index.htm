Founded in Milan in 1994 by four skateboarders, Comvert S.r.l. conceives, produces and distributes clothing for skateboarders and snowboarders under the brand bastard. Some years ago Comvert decided that it was about time to find a new location and set up its new headquarter and gave us the opportunity to search for the right building and then, possibly, to refurbish it. The ideal place had to be spacious enough to be able to host the administrative department, the design department, a flagship store, a storage facility, a wide access for the goods and a skate-bowl for bastard employees, friends and team riders.
