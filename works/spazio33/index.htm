In the middle of the 80’s Japanese architect Hajime Miyajima was commissioned to design a 3 hectares public garden in Oleggio, a small town in the North-West of Italy. With the aim to offer a portion of his land to the community, a local entrepreneur had in fact decided to sign a 25 years agreement and hand over the property, as well as a small pavilion, to the municipality. When the lease expired in 2009 the area laid in a state of such decay that the landlord took again initiative, regenerated the garden and commissioned BINOCLE to transform the pavilion in order to host a bar and a cafeteria. A new structure is inserted into the existing pavilion to enclose, define and make available a climatically controlled space. A new transparent façade is oriented toward the garden, articulated in accordance with the original plan and extended onward to generate a completely permeable veranda covered by a new projecting flat roof. The two main façades are revised to respond to the new function, but their relationship with the outside - closure and privacy towards the access road on the North, openness and transparency towards the park on the South - is preserved. Inside the bar a long wall is treated as a big black chalkboard on which is possible to make drawings, communicate daily dishes or leave personal messages. The first illustration on this wide canvas, made by BINOCLE, reproduces the pine trees planted outside. Every surface, apart from the ceiling and the large windows, is clad in natural maple wood. The equipped ceiling, built with perforated gypsum boards and acoustic MDF planks, is characterized by the contrast between the anonymity of the materials and the precision of its design, carefully developed to organize, host and conceal a variety of technical devices of unpleasant appearance and vital importance for the functioning of the bar.
