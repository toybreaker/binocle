Designed by Japanese architect Hiroshi Hara, the Satoyama Museum of Contemporary Art Kinare was one of the locations of the Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennale 2012. On that occasion Art Front Gallery asked Massimo Bartolini and BINOCLE to transform one side of the museum with a permanent art installation that could be used and inhabited.


On the footprint of a circle inscribed in the square of the overall plan, a long wooden bookcase organises the entire space with a bar and a restaurant on the front and a bookstore and a local radio station on the rear.


The bookcase is not only the storeroom for stocks of books and provisions of alimentary goods, but also the display of many objects with undefined functions and appearances. With the involvement of local communities the curved wall becomes a ‘museum inside the museum’ where handicraft products, memorabilia and knick-knacks are exhibited and exchanged with the principle of the object-crossing: you are allowed to take anything with you as long as you replace it with something from your own.


Suspended under the ceiling, randomly grouped and connected to electrical engines, 2000 polycarbonate disks cover the entire space and, when set in motion, slowly revolve on their misaligned hubs. This slight movement, enhanced during the Triennale by the soundtrack of Carsten Nicolai, is the fairy scenography that endlessly animates the room underneath.
