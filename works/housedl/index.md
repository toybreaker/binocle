Conversion of a derelict old house on the edge of a small village near Orvieto into the holiday residence for a Milanese art dealer and his guests.

The lengthy renovation was organized in two phases during a ten years span and connected the main house with an adjacent smaller building, two underlying caves and a tiny garden overlooking a striking ravine.
