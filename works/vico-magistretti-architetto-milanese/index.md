Set up for the exhibition ‘Vico Magistretti. Architetto milanese’ organised by Triennale Milano in collaboration with Fondazione studio museo Vico Magistretti in occasion of the centenary of the architect’s birth.

The main structures - a large table, a long shelf/wall and a gigantic hood - are designed as blow-ups of domestic archetypes, organise the exhibition space and allude to a place in which to work, design, think, stay and live. A single construction system and a single material confer unity and recognisability to the installation.
