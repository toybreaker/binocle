Conversion of a former movie theater into the headquarter of an Italian company founded by skateboarders to design, produce and distribute clothing and accessories for skateboarders and snowboarders under the brand bastard.

The 1.400 sqm venue accommodates office, warehouse, showroom, shop and skate bowl at disposal of everyday users and occasional visitors.
