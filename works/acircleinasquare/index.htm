Designed by Japanese architect Hiroshi Hara and built in 2003, the Satoyama Museum of Contemporary Art Kinare was one of the locations of the Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennale 2012.
On that occasion Art Front, a Tokyo-based Gallery, asked Massimo Bartolini and BINOCLE to transform one side of the museum with a permanent art installation that could be also used and inhabited by visitors.


Organized on the footprint of a circle inscribed in the square of the overall plan, a long wooden bookcase organises the entire space that hosts a bar and a restaurant on the front and a bookstore and a local radio station on the rear.



The bookcase is not merely a storeroom for stocks of books and provisions of alimentary goods, but also the display of many other objects with undefined functions and sometimes enigmatic appearances.


With the involvement of local communities the curved wall becomes a 'museum inside the museum' where handicraft products, handmade articles, memorabilia and knick-knacks are exhibited, replaced and exchanged with the principle of the object-crossing: you are allowed to take anything with you as long as you replace it with something from your own.


Thus the backdrop of the room becomes a lively Wunderkammer whose artists, collectors and curators are the visitors of the museum.



Suspended under the ceiling, randomly grouped and connected to a series of electrical engines, 2000 polycarbonate disks cover the entire space and, when set in motion, slowly revolve on their misaligned hubs.


This slight movement, enhanced during the Triennale by the soundtrack of Carsten Nicolai, is the fairy scenography that endlessly animates the room.
