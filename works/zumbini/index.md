Conversion of a 2.000 sqm industrial building from the 30â€™s into 17 new office units available for small practices or companies in search of a workplace to rent.

On a 1.350 sqm plot, two separate buildings are organised around a common courtyard: the bigger one is the result of the transformation of an existing structure while the smaller one is an entirely new construction.
