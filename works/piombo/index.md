This winning but unfulfilled proposal, conceived in 2010 in occasion of an invited competition, defined and worked out all the fundamental elements for Piombo’s future stores.

The project combined the sartorial vocation and the Italianness of the prestigious fashion menswear brand with the necessities of an uniform, reproducible and adaptable furniture system.
