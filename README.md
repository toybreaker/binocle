## No frills editing guide:

**Set homepage photo**

Mail the chosen photo named ```picture-of-the-day```. Min width 1800px (webmaster will make the image set!)

**Update contact infos, tel?**

Change [lines 11>15 in this file](https://github.com/toybreaker/binocle/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml)

**PROFILE fine tuning?**

Edit [this file](https://github.com/toybreaker/binocle/blob/gh-pages/_includes/editables/profile.md)

**PROFILE image change?**

Upload a picture named profile.jpg to the shared gdrive folder with same specs as for works images, then it will be processed by gulp as works images. (If in a hurry [upload](https://github.com/toybreaker/binocle/tree/gh-pages/assets/p) 3 pictures properly dimensioned named profile-640.jpg, profile-1024.jpg, profile-1920.jpg overwriting the existing ones.)

**WORKS: disable + enable project?**

Move project row form [works.csv](https://github.com/toybreaker/binocle/blob/gh-pages/_data/works.csv) to [works_to_finish.csv](https://github.com/toybreaker/binocle/blob/gh-pages/_data/works_to_finish.csv). When done, move it back.

**WORKS: new project?**

Add a new line [in this file](https://github.com/toybreaker/binocle/blob/gh-pages/_data/works.csv), make a folder with the work name and an index.htm inside it, with the correct front-matter.

## 2DOs:

- [ ] refactor to use .avif
- [ ] setup service workers for full Offline experience.
