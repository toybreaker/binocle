This winning but unfulfilled proposal, conceived in 2010 in occasion of an invited competition, defined and worked out all the fundamental elements for Piomboâ€™s future stores.

The project combined the sartorial vocation and the Italianness of the prestigious fashion menswear brand with the necessities of an uniform, reproducible and adaptable furniture system.
