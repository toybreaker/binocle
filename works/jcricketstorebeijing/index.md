The first J.Cricket store in the world opened in SKP-S Beijing and was conceived as a background sequence for the brand’s collection and for Jimin Lee’s world of inspiration.

The rather complex and quite restrained space has been organised through the careful composition of a series of varicoloured surfaces that work as backdrops for clothes, accessories and shoes on one hand and for an original - and constantly changing - selection of furniture, plants, objects and artworks that reflect and represent the sensibility of the brand’s designer.
