In the middle of the 80’s a local entrepreneur signed a 25 years agreement with the City of Oleggio, near Novara, and devolved a piece of land - a small park with a little pavilion - to the community.


When the lease expired the area laid in a state of decay and Corrado Beldì, the entrepreneur’s son, took the initiative, regenerated the garden and commissioned BINOCLE to transform the pavilion into a bar and cafeteria.


A new structure, inserted into the existing pavilion, encloses and defines a climatically controlled environment. A long glass window is oriented toward the park, articulated in accordance with the original plan and extended onward to generate a permeable veranda covered by a projecting flat roof.


The two main façades establish different relationships with the outside: closure and privacy towards the access road on the North, openness and transparency towards the landscape on the South.


Inside, the main wall is treated as a black chalkboard available to make drawings, communicate daily dishes or leave personal messages. Floor and walls are clad in natural maple wood while the equipped ceiling, built with perforated gypsum boards and acoustic MDF planks, is characterized by the contrast between the anonymity of the materials and the carefully designed precision through which a variety of technical devices of unpleasant appearance but vital importance are organised and concealed.
