Transformation of a decadent masonry pavilion into a new bar cafeteria available for the visitors of a small town’s public garden.

Inserted into the existing structure, shaped on the original footprint and oriented toward the park, a long glass window encloses a climatically controlled environment and extends onward generating a permeable veranda.
