Proposal for the conversion of an old industrial warehouse into the new atelier, archive and gallery for Yan Pei-Ming, a Chinese painter based in Ivry sur Seine, near Paris.

Few independent structures, each one accommodating a specific function, are organized within the huge covered space as if they were autonomous buildings spread out into a wide landscape.
